NOTES:

Added .gitignore, this ignores files created by Pycharm when committing and pushing. No changes required here.

If you are using any other external modules other than pygames add it to requirements.txt with the version number.
This lets PyCharm know what needs to be installed for the project.

If you are using a virtual python environment(venv) the .gitignore file also ignores that.
